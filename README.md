# The Task
 *The homework assignment was about how a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I reviewed the Homework Guide before I start working on this assignment. I began with starter code that was needed to be modified.* 

**Completed Acceptance Criteria**:

1. I followed the Scout Rule and left the code a little cleaner than when i found it.
2. I applied semantic HTML elements replacing all <div> elements.
3. The semantic HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
4. I included alts attributes in images for easy accessibility.
5. The heading attributes falls in sequential order.
6. I included a well illustrated title element.

**Bonus changes**:

1. I made sure all links are functioning correctly.
2. I made changes in the CSS style to make it efficient and accurate.
3. I organized CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
4. I also included comments on each element i updated in html and CSS.

**What did i do to complete this assingment?**:

*I had to learn how to get started with Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology.I had to understand the webpage purpose and content Research sources to clearly understand key concepts. I used the inspect section to figure out how the HTML and CSS code was written. I had to learn "What code refactoring is in Semantic HTML?". what is Web accesibility standards and How to edit Markdown files while Properly making use of a README.mb file Apply above concepts in the revision.*


**The Result**
*With the help of everyone combining to find the research, use application of concepts, and making specific changes to the files, we were able to ensure an accesible, efficient, and easy to read project.*
