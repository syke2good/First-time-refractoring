My Task
I reviewed the Homework Guide before I start working on this assignment. I began with starter code that was needed to be modified.

I had to learn how to get started with Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. This is apparently a common task for front-end and junior developers. The homework assignment was about how a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

I followed the Scout Rule and left the code a little cleaner than when i found it.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
